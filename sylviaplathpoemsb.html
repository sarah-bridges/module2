<h1>April 18</h1>
<h2>Sylvia Plath (1932-1963)</h2>
<h3>Presented by Sarah Bridges</h3>

<!--I like this poem, it has a sad vibe as with almost everything Sylvia Plath has ever written but I think the silver lining here is hope. Though not explicitly mentioned, there will still be tomorrow. A new future will reveal itself then.-->

<main>
<p>
the slime of all my yesterdays<br>
rots in the hollow of my skull
<!--This first line is so catching, I can immediately picture it.-->
</p>
<p>
and if my stomach would contract<br>
because of some explicable phenomenon<br>
such as pregnancy or constipation
</p>
<p>
I would not remember <mark>you</mark>
</p>
<p>
or that because of sleep<br>
infrequent as a moon&#127773; of greencheese<br>
that because of food<br>
nourishing as violet leaves<br>
that because of these
</p>
<p>
and in a few fatal yards of grass<br>
in a few spaces of sky and treetops
</p>
<p>
a future was lost yesterday<br>
as easily and irretrievable<br>
as a tennis ball at twilight
<!--I can't find my dog's tennis ball even in the daytime and neither can he-->
